Summary:

This is a react.js app with a reusable component simulating a download spinner. As the actual download progress is not known, the "download percentage" increments by 1% every 50ms. Download percentage and spinner stop and start on click of button. They can be reset to 0% once 100% is reached in previous cycle.



Was not able to complete in 2 hour time frame:

- Writing tests.
- Progress portion of spinner(blue) stays the same length instead of growing in proportion to download percentage. Did not have the time to work through CSS3 logic.
- Adding comments to code for readability.
